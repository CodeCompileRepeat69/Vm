 - [-] Implement basic Arithmetics [2/5] [%]
   - [X] unsigned 64-bit
   - [X] signed 64-bit
   - [ ] floating point
   - [ ] 32-bit
   - [ ] 8-bit
 - [ ] bit manipulation
 - [ ] system native interface
 - [ ] Object model
 - [ ] Garbage collection

* Ideas
** Managing complex objects
*** Grabage collection
*** Reference count

** Symbols

** Functions and closures
*** Simple machine-like model
*** More complex: function onbjects

** Objects and Classes
*** Inheritance
*** Protocol/traits
